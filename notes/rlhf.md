# How Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) works
Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is a machine learning technique that trains AI models to align better with human preferences and values. It's a key technique used to improve the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, making them more helpful, honest, and harmless. 
Here's a breakdown of the process:

## 1. Initial supervised training

    The process begins by taking a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), which has already learned basic language understanding from a massive text dataset.
    Human trainers then curate a high-quality dataset of prompts and desired responses, acting as both the user and the AI assistant.
    The LLM is fine-tuned on this dataset to learn a preliminary understanding of what constitutes a good response according to human standards. 

## 2. Reward model training

    Instead of explicitly defining a reward function, RLHF trains a separate Reward Model (RM) to predict human preferences.
    Human annotators are presented with multiple responses generated by the LLM for the same prompt and are asked to rank or rate them based on quality and preference.
    This preference data is used to train the RM, essentially teaching it to assign higher scores to responses that align with human judgment.  

## 3. Reinforcement learning fine-tuning

    The core of RLHF involves a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, often Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), that fine-tunes the LLM using the RM as a reward function.
    The LLM generates responses to prompts, and these responses are fed into the trained RM, which provides a reward signal based on predicted human preference.
    PPO then adjusts the LLM's parameters to maximize the reward received from the RM, encouraging it to generate responses that are increasingly aligned with human preferences. 

## 4. Iterative refinement

    The entire process is iterative, meaning it's repeated multiple times.
    As the LLM improves, new responses are generated, and human feedback continues to be collected and used to refine both the reward model and the LLM's policy. 

In essence
RLHF helps bridge the gap between AI's ability to generate plausible text and its capacity to produce content that is truly helpful, safe, and aligned with nuanced human expectations. By incorporating direct human feedback into the training loop, RLHF allows LLMs to learn and internalize complex human values that might be difficult to express through traditional, rule-based programming.
